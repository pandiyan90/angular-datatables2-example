# Angular Datatables2 Example

This component fetches jokes data from the Chuck Norris API based on user search terms (defaulting to "Welcome" if no search is provided). It utilizes the Angular Datatables library to display the jokes in a formatted table with columns for URL, Joke, and Updated At.

In the given project for displaying Chuck Norris Jokes, the interplay between AfterViewInit, *ngTemplateOutlet, and ng-template is crucial for proper data loading and rendering within the Angular Datatables component. Here's a breakdown of their importance:

1. ng-template (preview):

Defines a reusable block of HTML template named #preview.
This template contains the structure of the DataTable component, including the table element with classes for styling.
It acts as a blueprint for the DataTable's visual representation.
2. *ngTemplateOutlet:

Used within the component's HTML to dynamically render the pre-defined #preview template.
This allows for flexibility in positioning the DataTable within the component's layout.
By using *ngTemplateOutlet, the component can control when and where the DataTable is displayed.
3. AfterViewInit:

This lifecycle hook is invoked after the component's view is fully initialized.
In this project, it's used to ensure the dtOptions configuration for the DataTable is set before triggering the data fetch.
The dtOptions object holds crucial information like server-side processing and the ajax callback function that defines how to fetch data.
Why this interplay matters for joke loading:

The ng-template (#preview) defines the visual structure of the DataTable but doesn't handle data loading itself.
The dtOptions configuration, set in ngOnInit, defines how to fetch data from the API. However, it doesn't trigger the data fetch immediately.
AfterViewInit ensures the component's view is ready. It then triggers the data fetch by calling dtTrigger.next(dtOptions). This sends the configuration options to the DataTable component.
Once the data is fetched from the API using the ajax callback defined in dtOptions, the DataTable component can populate the table with the retrieved jokes.
In essence:

ng-template provides the structure.
dtOptions defines how to get the data.
AfterViewInit ensures everything is ready and triggers the data fetch using the configured dtOptions.
This combined approach ensures the DataTable is displayed with the proper structure and populated with Chuck Norris jokes only after the data is successfully loaded from the API.
